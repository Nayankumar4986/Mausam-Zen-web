**Project**
*Description: Developed a weather viewer application that retrieves weather data from a made-up API and displays it on a user-friendly interface.*
- Utilized JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the front-end of the application.
- Implemented the use of the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the weather API endpoint.
- Utilized `document.querySelector` to select and manipulate DOM elements dynamically.
- Converted temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius using a custom function.
- Displayed weather information such as city name, temperature, description, and wind speed.
- Incorporated weather icons in the UI by fetching and displaying the appropriate icons based on the weather conditions.
- Handled errors and provided user feedback for incorrect city names.

The Weather Viewer project showcases my ability to work with APIs, retrieve data, and present it in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. It also demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development technologies and problem-solving skills in handling data conversion and error handling.
